**SkillBridge Prep**

SkillBridge Prep is a web-based platform that connects teachers, trainers, and subject matter experts with students and aspirants who want to upskill or prepare for competitive examinations. It acts as an online marketplace where instructors can showcase their expertise, and learners can easily find and book classes tailored to their needs.
